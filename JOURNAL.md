## Total Hour Count: **2 Hours**

## November 14th

This is the start of this project, where I'm creating a MIDI keyboard through the guide of the Mini Midi Magic. 

I wasn't really sure how to create this, but I did have experience with electronic hardware in Kicad. I wanted to use the guide on Blueprint for the midi keyboard..... so that's what I did.

### Schematics

I use the guide from the Mini Midi Magic to create the schematics of the Midi Keyboard, adding components: the Orpheus Pico, DAC, Switches, Rotary Encoders, LCD and SD Card reader. I make the keybaord with 2 octaves like the guide and added 12 macros as fun buttons and 2 rotary encoders.

I was also able to select all the footprints of each component with the footprint in the guide.

After finishing the schematics, I imported the PCB from the schematics editor to the PCB editor and sorted all the components. I positioned all the switches in the correct location, like the high octave switches being on the right side and the low octave on the left side. I also placed the rotary encoders, DAC, LCD pin headers, and MCU in a suitable position on the PCB. I added holes for the screw insert as well as the GND zone for all the GND pins. 

I'm now ready to either create the code for the keyboard or create the case.

I also researched the parts I was going to use. This is semi-finished, and this is also just a rough estimate because I'm not completely sure how the midi kit would work.
