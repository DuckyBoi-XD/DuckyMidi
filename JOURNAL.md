## Total Hour Count: **2 Hours**

## November 14th

This is the start of this project, where I'm creating a MIDI keyboard through the guide of the Mini Midi Magic. 

I wasn't really sure how to create this, but I did have experience with electronic hardware in Kicad. I wanted to use the guide on Blueprint for the midi keyboard..... so that's what I did.

### Schematics

I use the guide from the Mini Midi Magic to create the schematics of the Midi Keyboard, adding components: the Orpheus Pico, DAC, Switches, Rotary Encoders, LCD and SD Card reader. I make the keybaord with 2 octaves like the guide and added 12 macros as fun buttons and 2 rotary encoders.

I was also able to select all the footprints of each component with the footprint in the guide.
