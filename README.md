- 2 rotary knobs for menu/Midi control
- 12 macro keys
- Orpheus Pico microcontroller
- Gateron Pro black switches to feel like a piano key
- Manual on/off switch

## Inspiration

The DuckyMidi was created using the help of the guide from the mini midi magic and was created for many reasons. I'm experienced in music and when I saw the guide for the midi made me intreseted in making a Midi keyboard myself. This was also a great time to revise/practise my PCB designing and CAD modeling.

## Construction
The DuckyMidi is created with a custom PCB and case.
